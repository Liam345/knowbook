# KnowBook Development Instructions

## Project Context

KnowBook is an **exact clone** of the reference application NoobBook located at `../NoobBook/`.

## Critical Development Rules

### 1. Exact Replication Policy
- **Clone NoobBook exactly** - same architecture, patterns, and functionality
- Study NoobBook files first, then replicate in KnowBook
- Match file structure, function signatures, and behavior precisely
- Do NOT improve, optimize, or "fix" patterns from the original

### 2. Naming Convention
- **NEVER** use "NoobBook" in any KnowBook code, comments, or documentation
- Replace all "NoobBook" references with "KnowBook" when replicating
- Replace all "noobbook" references with "knowbook"
- This applies to: variable names, strings, comments, error messages, logs

### 3. Reference Workflow
When implementing a new module:
1. Explore the corresponding NoobBook files
2. Understand the patterns and architecture
3. Replicate exactly in KnowBook with name substitutions
4. Test to ensure identical behavior

## Current Progress
